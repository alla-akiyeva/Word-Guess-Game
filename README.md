Hangman, or a word guess game, built with JavaScript. As as you open the page, the game randomly selects a word from a list of options that the user will need to guess.  The player will have 12 attempts to guess the word, after which the game will record either a win or a loss and reload the page. The selected word is console logged for the purposes of testing. The game has a sound effect to go along with theme.
